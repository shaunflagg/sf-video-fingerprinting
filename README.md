Video fingerprinting using perpetual hash

Requirements:
Python: The script is written in Python, so you'll need a Python interpreter. Typically, Python 3.x is recommended.

Python Libraries:

* opencv-python: Used for video processing.
* imagehash: Used for computing the perceptual hash.
* Pillow: Dependency for imagehash.
* ffmpeg: An external tool for re-encoding videos. It's invoked from the script using subprocess.
